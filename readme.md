#### By _**Taylor Phillips**_

## Description

_This web application was a friday project that required the use of a JavaScript loop.  When a user enters a number and pushes submit, the application will return a range of numbers counting from 0 to the number selected/inputted by the user.  Additionally, within that range of numbers, if a number contains a 1, a 2, or a 3, that number will be replaced with a robot-like response.

   ### Application Specs

| :--------:  | :---------: | :-----: |
| When a number in the list contains a 1, it will be returned as "Beep!"  | 10 | Beep! |
| If a number in the list contains a 2 then it will return "Boop." and disregard the 1's condition | 12 | Boop. |
| When there is a 3 within a number, it will be switched to "Won't you be my neighbor?" and disregard the conditions for 1's and 2's on that number | 132 | Won't you be my neighbor? |
