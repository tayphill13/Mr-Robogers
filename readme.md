# _Mr Robogers Neighborhood_

#### _An application that will return a greeting to the user, 6.12.2020_

#### By _**Taylor Phillips**_

## Description

_This web application was a friday project that required the use of a JavaScript loop.  When a user enters a number and pushes submit, a range of numbers will be returned that go from 0 to the number selected/inputted by the user.  Additionally, in that return, every number containing a 1 will be returned as a "Beep!" instead of that number.  If the number value contains a 2 in the list of numbers then that number will instead be returned as the word, "Boop." . And if the number in the list has a 3, then it will be returned as "Won't you be my neighbor?" For this web application, "3's" will override the return action of the 2 and the 1, and "2's" will override the return action of the 1_
